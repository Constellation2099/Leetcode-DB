Question

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.

Solution:

We need to take 2 cases, one for an even palindrome and another for an odd palindrome.
The concept used is expand from center.
Run only onw for loop across the string for all characters.
Initialize l=i for left pointer and r=i for right pointer. (Odd Palindrome)
Consider that character as center and with a while loop for l>=0 and (r<length of string) and expand around its center.
Do the same for Even Plaindrome but initialize r=i+1
